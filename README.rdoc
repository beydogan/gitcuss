== Gitcussion

Gitcussion is a platform for discussing Github repositories. You can learn more about a project, library, gem or anything available on Github. Or you can leave a comment about it.

== Motivation

After reading Readme, I always look for last commit date and watch, star, fork counts to evaluate libraries(gems for ruby) 
then I decide to use it or not. 
But sometimes thats not enough. I want to learn what people think about it. Thats why I've built Gitcussion.

== Google Chrome Plugin
Google Chrome plugin is available for better experience. You can see repo details just in the GitHub page of the repo.
